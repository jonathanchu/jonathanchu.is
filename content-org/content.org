I've always been interested in developer experience and understanding the metrics often used to measure this unique type of productivity. It's extremely enticing to think that If I could change my tooling, gain insight through telemetry and other metrics, I could potentially "game" a better and more fullfilling developer experience overall - and ultimately over-achieve when typically I would just coast through. The experience I'm talking about improving is not so much solely about the 9-5 day job work, but more about the overarching craft of engineering. Whether you're coding away on pet projects on nights and weekends, tinkering with editors or Linux distros, or learning new technologies and programming languages for work, the underlying takeaways and insights one could gain from these developer experience metrics would carry over to all tangible coding activities that we do.

A while back, I watched one of Adam Tornhill's talks on YouTube and the idea of "Your Code as a Crime Scene". This was around the time that I started dabbling with Clojure and when I found out he wrote a book of the same title that followed a tool he released online, written in Clojure - it was a perfect match of interests and technology for me. Cloning the repo and following the README, code-maat <https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat> was relatively easy to get up and running for baseline code analysis. The basic gist of this all is that you install the repo and run some jars over a git log that you save locally for static analysis. The GitHub page is well-documented but perhaps I will share my own notes (in the Notes section) for how I got it up and running at least.

I decided to run this against a personal (what feels like a lifelong or lifetime) endeavor, my emacs config, and was curious to see what the output was. What follows was some insights, however obvious some may be, but also insightful findings from the code-maat output.

Top-level numbers on my dotemacs https://github.com/jonathanchu/dotemacs repo. Over 11 years and 1,738 commits of config changes, visual UI and modeline tweaking, and transitions to org mode literate source blocks back to plain old elisp (and maybe a few more cycles of that dance over the years) ;)

Hotspots (Most Changed Files)

This highlights files with the highest change frequency. These are potential hostpost where bugs tend to cluster and where refactoring may have the highest impact. Since these are screenshots, the large red dot in the first quadrant is my init.el file.

[[/images/code-forensics-change-frequency.png]]

[[/images/code-forensics-hotspot-bubble-chart.png]]

Temporal Coupling is an interesting relationship insight into files and pairs of files.

What this shows is files that frequently change together in the same commits. High coupling (60%+) between unrelated files may indicate hidden dependencies. Low coupling between related files (like .el and .org) is expected and healthy. There were no surprises here other than being impressed at how well this worked on first analysis. For example, when my emacs-init.org changed, so did my emacs-init.el in an expected and coupled manner.

[[/images/code-forensics-temporal-coupling.png]]

Code Complexity vs Change Frequency

I think this was the most interesting and valuable metric and visualization. This is the "hotspot" visualization from the book and files in the upper-right quadrant (large file AND frequently changed) are the highest priority for refactoring.

[[/images/code-forensics-hotspot.png]]

I took it a step further and put an overlay over the hotspot chart to better show the risk and complexity.

[[/images/code-forensics-hotspot-overlay.png]]

This chart shows the files plotted by complexity (LOC in this case) vs change frequency, with quadrants indicating refactoring priority.
- Top-Right (Red): High complexity + High churn = Refactor now — these are your biggest risks
- Top-Left (Orange): High complexity + Low churn = Consider refactoring — complex but stable
- Bottom-Right (Yellow): Low complexity + High churn = Monitor — lots of changes but manageable
- Bottom-Left (Green): Low complexity + Low churn = Leave alone — no action needed


All in all, this was a really neat and interesting tool to play around with, despite it being on a somewhat trivial, but active, repository. I am thinking of how I can leverage this in my day-to-day in a more automated way. In the meantime, if you want to try this out for yourself (go see code-maat) or just want to get your toes wet with static code analysis, I extracted the essential git commands for you to replicate this to a smaller degree. Give it a shot and see what insights you can gain!

** Dark Mode Toggle for iTerm and Emacs                            :emacs:
 :PROPERTIES:
 :EXPORT_DATE: 2020-07-12T00:00:00-04:00
 :EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: "How to do dark and light mode toggle with iTerm and Emacs“
 :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: dark-mode-toggle-emacs-iterm
 :END:
For most of my life, I've always preferred a dark theme when it comes to coding whether I'm in Emacs or the terminal. Lately though, the past two years specifically, I've switched to a light theme for both Emacs and iTerm. I really don't have a better rationale other than I feel like the lighter theme means it's "work" time and helps me focus, whereas a dark theme would be more suitable if I was coding at night and wanted to save some eye strain from a full day of looking at a computer screen.

With that said, I've definitely utilized Mac OS X's dark mode toggle and the one thing that has bothered me was the white glare of my Emacs and terminal when I was coding at night.  I wrote up a series of scripts inspired by Anantha Kumaran's excellent post on this exact issue called [[https://ananthakumaran.in/2020/05/09/dark-mode-toggle.html][Dark Mode Toggle]].

Now, I can type a single command in terminal and it would change to a dark theme in both Emacs and iTerm.

[[/images/emacs-iterm-light-dark-toggle.gif]]

And here are the scripts that I wrangled together to achieve this:

Toggle to a dark Emacs theme:

Filename: emacs-dark-theme
#+NAME: emacs-dark-theme
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/sh
set -e

if pgrep Emacs > /dev/null; then
    emacsclient --eval "(load-theme 'doom-one t)" > /dev/null
fi
#+END_SRC

Toggle to a dark iTerm color scheme using AppleScript and iTerm's Python API:

Filename: iterm2_dark_theme.py
#+NAME: iterm2_dark_theme.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import iterm2

async def main(connection):
    # Get the color preset we'd like
    preset = await iterm2.ColorPreset.async_get(connection, "One Dark")
    profiles = await iterm2.PartialProfile.async_query(connection)
    for partial in profiles:
        # Fetch the full profile and then set the color preset in it
        profile = await partial.async_get_full_profile()
        await profile.async_set_color_preset(preset)

iterm2.run_until_complete(main)
#+END_SRC

Call the iTerm Python script via AppleScript:

Filename: iterm-dark-theme
#+NAME: iterm-dark-theme
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
tell application "iTerm2"
    launch API script named "iterm2_dark_theme.py"
end tell
#+END_SRC

I combine calling these scripts with one command like so:

Filename: dark-mode
#+NAME: dark-mode
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/sh
set -e

/bin/bash /Users/jonathan/projects/dotfiles/bin/emacs-dark-theme
osascript /Users/jonathan/projects/dotfiles/bin/iterm-dark-theme
#+END_SRC

And now this all can be ran with just:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ dark-mode
#+END_SRC

The same workflow can be done for switching back to a light theme by creating a new set of these scripts and modifying to the light theme you want!

Thank you to [[https://ananthakumaran.in/2020/05/09/dark-mode-toggle.html][Anantha Kumaran]] for this first post and all credit goes to him!

Happy (night) hacking!

** Emacs, Notmuch, isync, and msmtp Setup                               :emacs:

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: emacs-notmuch-isync-msmtp-setup
:END:
I've been meaning to move my email management to Emacs for the past year and finally made the jump after see [[https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/][Mike Zamansky's]] video on this ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrsoIwJ-UM][YouTube]]). Here are my notes on how I got this all setup and configured.

This is an opinionated setup based on Mac OS X and Fastmail. First, make sure you have [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] installed to install the packages needed.

**** Receiving email

[[https://notmuchmail.org/][Notmuch]] requires email to be stored on your local filesystem and one message per file. We'll be using =isync= for this.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ brew install isync
#+END_SRC

http://isync.sourceforge.net/

You'll need to start out with an initial config which you can copy directly to your home directory.

My =.mbsyncrc= file looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
# First section: remote IMAP account
IMAPAccount fastmail
Host imap.fastmail.com
Port 993
User jonathanchu@fastmail.com
# For simplicity, this is how to read the password from another file.
# For better security you should use GPG https://gnupg.org/
PassCmd "cat ~/.mbsync-fastmail"
SSLType IMAPS
SSLVersions TLSv1.2

IMAPStore fastmail-remote
Account fastmail

# This section describes the local storage
MaildirStore fastmail-local
Path ~/Maildir/
Inbox ~/Maildir/INBOX
SubFolders Verbatim

# This section a "channel", a connection between remote and local
Channel fastmail
Master :fastmail-remote:
Slave :fastmail-local:
Patterns *
Expunge None
CopyArrivalDate yes
Sync All
Create Slave
SyncState *
#+END_SRC

The contents of =.mbsync-fastmail= contains my email password, which is probably not the best way to do store a password like this locally so I should fix this in the near future.

Once this is configured and saved in your home directory, you can then run run =mbsync= to pull your email down locally:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ mbsync -a
#+END_SRC

Note, you'll have to run this each time to retrieve new mail. I know some folks might elect to have this as a running cron job every x minutes - this can be entirely based on your preference and email workflow.

And finally, we just need to setup a search database for =notmuch= to work by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ notmuch new
#+END_SRC

**** Viewing and writing email

We're going to use =Notmuch=, specifically in Emacs, to view our mail. First, you need to install =Notmuch= on your OS:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ brew install notmuch
#+END_SRC

Once =notmuch= is installed, run the following command to setup =notmuch=. This will create a =.notmuch-config= in your home directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ notmuch setup
#+END_SRC

When you have entered your email information, in your Emacs configuration, you can install =notmuch-emacs= by including the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package notmuch
  :ensure t
  :defer t)
#+END_SRC

Then, you can run =m-x notmuch-hello= and you will be greeted with the =notmuch= starting screen.

#+CAPTION: m-x notmuch-hello
#+NAME: fig:notmuch-hello
[[/images/notmuch-hello.png]]

#+CAPTION: notmuch unread
#+NAME: fig:notmuch unread
[[/images/notmuch-unread.png]]

**** Sending email
Next, we'll need to send our mail with something, so I chose =msmtp= because of how easy it was to configure.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ brew install msmtp
#+END_SRC

The contents of my =.msmtprc= file looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
defaults
auth on
protocol smtp
tls on

account fastmail
host smtp.fastmail.com
port 465
user jonathanchu@fastmail.com
passwordeval "cat ~/.mbsync-fastmail"
tls_starttls off
from jonathanchu@fastmail.com

account default : fastmail
#+END_SRC

Add this bit in your Emacs config:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it
      sendmail-program "/usr/local/bin/msmtp"
      mail-specify-envelope-from t
      message-sendmail-envelope-from 'header
      mail-envelope-from 'header)
#+END_SRC

This article will be updated as I refine my email process and work out the bugs, but at this point you should have working email with Notmuch in Emacs!

** Installing Code Maat
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_DATE: 2026-01-21T00:00:00-04:00
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: installing-code-maat
:EXPORT_HUGO_CODE_FENCE: t

*** Overview

Code Maat is a forensic analysis tool for version control data, created by Adam Tornhill (author of "Your Code as a Crime Scene"). It analyzes git logs to identify hotspots, temporal coupling, code age, and other metrics. These are my notes and install instructions as I got it setup on my local machine.

- Repository: https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat
- Book: "Your Code as a Crime Scene" by Adam Tornhill

*** Installation

**** 1. Install Java

Code Maat is a Clojure application packaged as a JAR file, so it requires Java.

#+begin_src bash
brew install openjdk
#+end_src

Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):

#+begin_src bash
export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"
#+end_src

Or create a system-wide symlink:

#+begin_src bash
sudo ln -sfn $(brew --prefix)/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
#+end_src

Verify installation:

#+begin_src bash
java -version
#+end_src

**** 2. Download Code Maat

#+begin_src bash
mkdir -p ~/tools/code-forensics
cd ~/tools/code-forensics
curl -sL https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat/releases/download/v1.0.4/code-maat-1.0.4-standalone.jar -o code-maat.jar
#+end_src

Verify installation:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -h
#+end_src

**** 3. Optional: Create an alias

Add to your shell profile:

#+begin_src bash
alias code-maat="java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar"
#+end_src

*** Usage

**** Step 1: Generate Git Log

Code Maat requires a specially formatted git log. Run this in your project directory:

#+begin_src bash
git log --all --numstat --date=short \
  --pretty=format:'--%h--%ad--%aN' \
  --no-renames > gitlog.txt
#+end_src

**** Step 2: Run Analysis

All commands assume you're in the project directory with =gitlog.txt=.

***** Change Frequency (Hotspots)

Find files that change most often:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -l gitlog.txt -c git2 -a revisions
#+end_src

***** Temporal Coupling

Find files that change together:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -l gitlog.txt -c git2 -a coupling
#+end_src

***** Authors / Ownership

Who changed what:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -l gitlog.txt -c git2 -a authors
#+end_src

Primary author per file:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -l gitlog.txt -c git2 -a entity-ownership
#+end_src

***** Code Age

When files were last changed:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -l gitlog.txt -c git2 -a age
#+end_src

***** Code Churn

Lines added/removed per file:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -l gitlog.txt -c git2 -a abs-churn
#+end_src

***** Summary

Repository overview:

#+begin_src bash
java -jar ~/tools/code-forensics/code-maat.jar -l gitlog.txt -c git2 -a summary
#+end_src
