Hello! My name is Jonathan Chu and this is my personal website. I'm a
software engineer currently living in New Jersey with a passion for
Python web development. This site is intended to be a place to share
the things I've learned along the way.

In late 2010, I founded 3atmospheres, a web development shop based in
New York, where I consulted and worked with a variety of agencies,
small businesses, and startups in New York.  I've been a remote
engineer since 2011.
