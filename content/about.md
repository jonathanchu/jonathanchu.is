Hello! My name is Jonathan Chu and this is my personal website. I'm a
software engineer currently living in New Jersey with a passion for
building web-based products and tools. This site is a place to share
the things I've learned along the way.

I'm currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [Simple
Health](https://www.simplehealth.com) and previously I was a Lead
Software Engineer at [GitPrime](https://www.gitprime.com) and
[YesGraph](https://www.yesgraph.com). In late 2010, I founded
[3atmospheres](https://www.3atmospheres.com), a web development agency
based in New York, where I consulted and worked with a variety of
agencies, small businesses, and startups in New York. I've been a
remote engineer since 2011.

I'm passionate about all things Emacs, functional languages, and
building tools to enhance engineer productivity. I have experience
working across the entire technology stack - whether it be data
modeling, backend, frontend, and system design and architecture.
