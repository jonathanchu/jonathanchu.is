Title: About

Hello! My name is Jonathan Chu and this is my personal website. I'm a web developer currently living in New York with a passion for Python web development. This site is intended to be a place to share the things I've learned along the way.

In late 2010, I founded 3atmospheres, a web development shop based here in New York. You can find out more about my professional experience by checking out my resume.
