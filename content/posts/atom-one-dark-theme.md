This past weekend I hacked together a new Emacs color theme that is
essentially a port of a [Atom.io's](https://atom.io/)
[One Dark theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax).
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Here's the repo for this - [One Dark Theme for Emacs](https://github.com/jonathanchu/atom-one-dark-theme)

It is based off of the official syntax and UI themes:

* [One Dark UI](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui)
* [One Dark Syntax](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax)

I use Emacs as my main text editor for any kind of real work, but I do
like to keep up the other editors out there just to keep my ear to the
ground. That's pretty much how I discovered that they added a new core
theme called One Dark - when I opened up the editor the other day. :)

And while many may joke around that the world needs "yet
another text editor", I think Atom.io is doing some really great
things. For starters, I was really impressed by the active community
they already have. Their packaging system really isn't anything new by
standards today, and it's also arguable that being built by GitHub
immediately drew more interest and adoption simply because of the name
backing it, but you can't deny the sheer number of active participants
submitting new packages each day.

Back to the Emacs theme itself, it is a work in progress and pull
requests are greatly welcomed!  Here's a screenshot of the theme:

In the screenshot, for those curious the font is Inconsolata and I use
 `smart-mode-line`. My whole emacs config can be found
