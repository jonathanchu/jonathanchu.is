I've been learning Clojure in my spare time and coming from a
predominantly Python-focused career, I wanted to chronicle my
experiences with learning Clojure and integrating it witin my Emacs
config.

This article will be geared towards beginners, like me, looking to get
started with Clojure and Emacs on OS X.

1) Install Homebrew
2) Install Homebrew Cask
3) brew cask install java
4) brew install leiningen
5) Make sure exec path setup in emacs (ex. `/usr/local/bin`)
6) package-install cider, 4clojure
7) profiles.clj
8) What to do for message about "WARNING: CIDER requires nREPL 0.2.7 to work properly"
