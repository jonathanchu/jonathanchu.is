<span>Setting Up Deft Mode in Emacs with Org-Mode</span>
========================================================

I've been a big fan of [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) for
quite a few years now - and more recently,
[nValt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) which is a popular
fork of Notational Velocity, but with a bit more features. Everyone has
their own process when it comes to taking notes, and to each his own,
but the one thing that really turned me on to Notational Velocity/nValt
is the simplicity and unstructured process of taking and searching for
notes. Coupled with Dropbox for seamless syncing, you have yourself a
great note taking process that was easy to use and even easier to
search. As for mobile, I used [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/) to
view my notes via Dropbox, and it made taking notes during programming
meetups or business meetings even easier. Life is good!

</p>
However, over the past year, as I found myself coding more and more in
my text editor of choice, Emacs - the more I found myself wanting
something that didn't seem so disconnected from where I do most of my
prose and coding. After a quick search, I found [Jason
Blevins'](http://jblevins.org/) great little creation called
[Deft](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/). To sum it up, Deft is an
open source mode for Emacs to view, record, and search for notes in
plain text, very much like Notational Velocity/nValt. I highly encourage
you to check out Jason's [project page for
Deft](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/). After trying out Deft, it
made me want to switch 100% over to org-mode notes as I really only used
org-mode for sporadic notes. Now, I have the power of org-mode with
Emacs in a Notational Velocity-like buffer with Deft. The rest of the
article will be outlining how I set it up in my Emacs config.

</p>
Setting up Deft
---------------

</p>
First, go grab [deft.el](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/deft.el) and
make sure it is available in your Emacs config (i.e. -
\~/.emacs/vendor/deft.el path). You can grab it
[here](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/deft.el) or get it directly
from my [Emacs
config](https://github.com/jonathanchu/emacs/blob/master/vendor/deft.el),
which is the original unmodified file.

</p>
Once `deft.el` is on your Emacs load path, you'll need to tell Emacs to
use Deft. Put the following anywhere in your config (I like to keep
`modes` separated in it's own `modes.el` file that gets loaded on
initialization):

</p>
    (require 'deft)

</p>
Since I use Org-Mode, I want `*.org` files to be recognized by the Deft
buffer, so let's set the `deft-extension` to "org". I believe the
default file type that Deft will look for is "txt", so omit this part or
add in "txt" if you want to use plain text files.

</p>
    (setq deft-extension "org")

</p>
And again, since I'm using org-mode with Deft, let's set the
`deft-text-mode` appropriately to use org-mode:

</p>
    (setq deft-text-mode 'org-mode)

</p>
Next, we need to tell Deft where to find all of my current org-mode
files. In my case, I like to keep all my org-mode files in Dropbox, so
that path would be `~/Dropbox/org` for me. You should change this path
to wherever you keep your files.

</p>
    (setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/org")

</p>
Finally, the last bit of customization is to tell Deft to use the
filename as a title. By default, Deft will use the first line of the
file as the filename. In my note taking preference, I normally don't
lead off a note with the title of the file (it's usually a date like
"2013-08-15" if it's a meeting), so I switched on the trigger for this:

</p>
    (setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)

</p>
Putting it all together, and you have this in its entirety:

</p>
    ;; deft(require 'deft)(setq deft-extension "org")(setq deft-directory "~/Dropbox/org")(setq deft-text-mode 'org-mode)(setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)

</p>
Using Deft
----------

</p>
To enter the Deft buffer, simply do:

</p>
    m-x deft ENTER

</p>
And you should see the Deft buffer like so, with all of your org-files
(yes, I know - nothing is blurred out...I got nothing to hide :P ):

</p>

</p>
Start typing and you'll see the list of notes filter out the results
that do not match, just like Notational Velocity. Hit ENTER to open the
note in a new buffer.

</p>
And there you have it! Much appreciation and thanks goes to [Jason
Blevins](http://jblevins.org/) for this awesome mode that has
effectively streamlined my coding and note-taking all in Emacs!
