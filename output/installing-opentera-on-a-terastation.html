<span>Installing OpenTera on a TeraStation</span>
=================================================

I have a Buffalo TeraStation that I bought in 2006 to store all my big
media files. Through the years it has served me well, although with Mac
OS X Lion, connectivity to the TeraStation stopped working altogether -
mainly due to Lion's changed AFP connectivity. Usually with hardware of
this age, it would be simply replaced; however, I've always found
Buffalo's hardware to be of great quality which is a testament to how
long it's lasted. Sadly, installing OpenTera has been on my TODO list
for roughly a year now, so this fix is overdue. Buffalo officially
responded that there will be a firmware fix for this in the future, but
that was over a year ago. This is a quick walkthrough of how I got
read/write access back on the TeraStation through Mac OS X Lion. Note: I
did the download and firmware updates from my Windows PC, telnet from
Mac OS X Lion.

</p>
1\) Find out the firmware version of your TeraStation. At the time of
writing, I have v2.14. Download the corresponding firmware version from
this [site](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/itimpi/telnet.htm) and install
it. This is essentially the same firmware but with telnet enabled.
You'll need telnet enabled to log into the TeraStation to install
OpenTera.

</p>
2\) Download OpenTera Update v5 and Samba 3 from this
[site](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/itimpi/opentera.htm). Unzip and move
this on the TeraStation where you can later access it. I moved this into
my "Share" directory.

</p>
3\) Telnet into the TeraStation. I believe the default user for the
firmware is "myroot", which you should use to telnet in.

</p>
    $ telnet 192.168.0.108Trying 192.168.0.108...Connected to 192.168.0.108.Escape character is '^]'.Password:Login incorrectTERASTATION login: myrootroot@TERASTATION:~#

</p>
4\) Change directories into the OpenTera directory, the one you just
placed on the TeraStation, and run the `Update_OpenTera.sh` script.

</p>
    root@TERASTATION:/# cd mnt/array1/share/OpenTera_v5/root@TERASTATION:/mnt/array1/share/OpenTera_v5# ./Update_OpenTera.sh

</p>
This script is an interactive install, so it will prompt you to say "y"
a few times. Go ahead and do so. If all is successful, you should see:

</p>
    [OpenTera] ============ OpenTera Install Completed ===============

</p>
5\) Next, change directories into the Samba directory and run the
`Update_Samba.sh` script.

</p>
    root@TERASTATION:/mnt/array1/share/OpenTera_v5# cd /mnt/array1/share/samba-3.0.37_ppc/root@TERASTATION:/mnt/array1/share/samba-3.0.37_ppc# ./Update_Samba.sh

</p>
When all is completed, you should see:

</p>
    *********************************************************************            Completed samba-3.0.37_ppc.tgz install*********************************************************************

</p>
And that's it! I was able to access the TeraStation from Mac OS X Lion.
Hopefully this will be helpful to someone else out there, as I know I'm
not the only one with this problem. If I missed any steps, let me know -
good luck!
